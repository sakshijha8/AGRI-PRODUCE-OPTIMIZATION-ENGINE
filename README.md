# AGRI-PRODUCE-OPTIMIZATION-ENGINE
As we all know that agriculture depends largely on the nature of soil and the climatic conditions and many a times, we face unpredictable changes in climate like, non-seasonal rainfall or heat waves or fluctuations in humidity levels, etc. and all such events cause a great loss to our farmers and farming, because of which they are not able to utilize their agricultural land to it's fullest.So to solve all such problems, I have build a Machine Learning Model by the virtue of which we can help farmers, optimize the agricultural production, because this predictive model will help them understand that for a particular soil & given climatic condition, which crop will be best suitable for the harvest.

# Goal -
To achieve precision farming by optimizing the agricultural production.
The project is intended on Precision Farming.

➔ To Optimize Productivity

➔ By Understanding requirements of climatic and soil conditions for crops.

➔ Helps us to Cope up with weather unpredictability.
# About The Dataset Used (data.csv) -
The Dataset Consists of 22 Unique Crops such as Maize, Wheat, Mango, Watermelon, Mango etc.

➔ The dataset consists of climatic conditions required to grow the crops.

   ◆ Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall.

➔ The dataset also consists of soil conditions required to grow the crops

   ◆ N: The Ratio of Nitrogen Content in Soil.
   
   ◆ P: The Ratio of Phosphorus Content in Soil.
   
   ◆ K: The Ratio of Potassium Content in Soil.
   
   ◆ pH: pH of the Soil
